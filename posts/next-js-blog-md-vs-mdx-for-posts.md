## Introduction

When building a blog with Next.js, one of the key decisions is how to source and render blog posts. Two popular formats for writing blog posts are Markdown (.md) and MDX (.mdx). Both formats offer a straightforward way to write content, but they differ in their capabilities, especially when it comes to handling images within the text. In this article, we'll explore the differences between using .md and .mdx files for blog posts in a Next.js application, with a particular focus on inserting images.

## Markdown (.md) Files

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for formatting text on the web. .md files are plain text files that use Markdown syntax to format the content. When using .md files for blog posts in a Next.js application, you typically rely on a library like `remark` or `markdown-it` to parse the Markdown into HTML.

### Image Handling in .md Files

Inserting images in .md files is straightforward. You can use the Markdown image syntax: `![alt text](image_url)`. However, managing image paths and optimizing images for web use can require setup. 

For instance, you might need to configure your Next.js project to properly handle image assets, possibly using `next/image` for optimization.

## MDX (.mdx) Files

MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to use JSX within your Markdown files. This means you can import and use React components directly in your .mdx files, making it a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive content.

### Image Handling in .mdx Files

One of the of using .mdx files is the ability to import and use React components, including those for image handling. For example, you can import `Image` fromnext/image` and use it within your .mdx file to optimize images. This is particularly useful for responsive images and automatic lazy loading.
